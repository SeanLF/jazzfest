          <blockquote cite="https://ottawajazzfestival.com" class="blockquote">
            <p>It is with a heavy heart that the TD Ottawa Jazz Festival cancelled the 2020 edition when the City of Ottawa announced that it had extended closures on public gatherings until June 30th.</p>
  
            <p>While we stand by this ordinance, it nevertheless has enormous ramifications for so many. To date we have reached out to all the musicians who were scheduled to perform, our sponsors and funders, contractors, the myriad of businesses we associate with, our volunteers and our ticket purchasers (see the detailed instructions below). We are grateful to everyone's encouragement and will continue to collaborate closely with TD, OLG and our government funders to secure financing for 2021.</p>
  
            <p>Currently, the Festival's programming team is exploring ideas to provide opportunities for artists and audiences to share in a rich and moving musical experience. We look forward to sharing these plans at the earliest opportunity.</p>
  
            <p>Our hearts go out to everyone who has been so personally affected by this pandemic. Please remember to follow the directions of our health officials: stay indoors until further notice and stay safe. We will be there to welcome you when it's time to gather again to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the TD Ottawa Jazz Festival in 2021.</p>
  
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns, call the office to leave a message at <a href="tel:+16132412633">613-241-2633</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:contact@ottawajazzfestival.com">contact@ottawajazzfestival.com</a>.</p>
