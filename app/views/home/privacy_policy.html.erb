<h3>Do we use 'cookies'?</h3>

  For instance, we use cookies to remember who you are between visits and keep track of actions you're authorized to perform.
</p>
<p>
  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.

<h3>Third Party Disclosure</h3>
